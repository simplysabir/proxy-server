This Rust-based proxy server, utilizing the Hyper and Tower crates, is designed to asynchronously intercept, log, and forward HTTP requests. It operates by differentiating request paths into two categories: those beginning with /api, logged as "API Path," and all others, logged as "Generic Path." The server showcases a simple yet effective use of Rust's powerful asynchronous capabilities and the robustness of the Hyper and Tower libraries for handling and forwarding HTTP requests. Upon receiving a request, it logs the request path according to its category and then forwards the request as received, making it a straightforward tool for observing and proxying HTTP traffic.
